# üõí Product MicroService - E-commerce Backend Module

## Overview

The **Product Service** is a core microservice within our e-commerce platform.  
It is responsible for managing the life cycle of product-related data, including product information, media resources, and customer feedback.

It is built with **Spring Boot**, **MyBatis-Plus**, and integrates with other microservices via **Eureka** (service discovery) and **Spring Cloud Config**.

---

## Project Structure

The `product-service` project follows a standard **Spring Boot + MyBatis Plus** architecture,  
with clear separation of concerns across configuration, controller, service, DAO, and entity layers.


- `config/`  
  ‚û§ Configuration classes including API response wrappers, Swagger config, Security settings, and global exception handling.

- `controller/`  
  ‚û§ RESTful API controllers for Product, ProductMedia, and ProductFeedback modules.

- `dao/`  
  ‚û§ MyBatis Plus mapper interfaces for interacting with the database.

- `entity/`  
  ‚û§ Domain model classes that map to database tables.

- `exception/`  
  ‚û§ Custom exception definitions used for error handling.

- `service/` and `service/impl/`  
  ‚û§ Interfaces and implementations of business logic.

- `resources/`  
  ‚û§ Configuration files (`application.properties`) and static resources.

- `ProductServiceApplication.java`  
  ‚û§ The main entry point of the Spring Boot application.

- `pom.xml`  
  ‚û§ Maven configuration for dependencies and build settings.
